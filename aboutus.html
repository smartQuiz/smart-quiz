          <p id="abritni" class="abparagraph"> Hello! My name is Britni Malloy. <br> I used to work at a bank and was looking for ideas before deciding to go back to school to use my new GI Bill Benefits. I could not stand the system we used to do our work. I was constantly coming up with
            new ideas that would make the system better and more user friendly and make our work more efficient. I just had no idea how to do, much less how to go about doing any such things. So, I enrolled in school in a Computer Information Systems.
            Unfortunately, it didn't do anything to help me get a job. In fact, it probably hindered me. Then the Apprenti program came along and gave me this great oppurtunity.</p>

            Right now I'm learning to code here at Code Fellows and I'm super excited to be on my way to start working at Microsoft.</p>

            <br> I am an Air Force veteran and I also worked for the department of veterans affairs. I decided to become a software developer because I wanted to create, contribute and challenge myself. I love that we can use code to create things from
            the ground up. With coding I am constantly challenged and learning new skills. Most importantly I hope to one day help build technology that can change the world for the better</p>
