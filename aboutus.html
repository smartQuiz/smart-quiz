      <p class="about" id="abritni"> Hello! My name is Britni Malloy. I used to work at a bank and was looking for ideas before deciding to go back to school to use my new GI Bill Benefits. I could not stand the system we used to do our work. I was constantly coming up with new ideas that would make the system better and more user friendly and make our work more efficient. I just had no idea how to do, much less how to go about doing any such things. So, I enrolled in school in a Computer Information Systems. Unfortunately, it didn't do anything to help me get a job. In fact, it probably hindered me. I have been trying to get into the IT field, preferably programming such as web design (which is my major) or software development, for a few years now. I started while I was in school and have been trying ever since until the wonderful Apprenti program came along.</p>

      <p class="about" id="sugey">My name is Sugey Valencia , I am an Air Force veteran and I also worked for the department of veterans affairs. I decided to become a software developer because I wanted to create, contribute and challenge myself. I love that we can use code to create things from the ground up. With coding I am constantly challenged and learning new skills. Most importantly I hope to one day help build technology that can change the world for the better.</p>

      About 6 years ago I moved here to the US with my wife, and it has been a great experience. Right now I'm learning to code here at Code Fellows and I'm super excited to be on my way to start working at Microsoft.</p>
