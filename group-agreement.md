# Group Agreement Handbook

# Project: Smart-Quiz

* Communication Plan:

  We agree to have an open communication agreement where each member is able and encouraged to share his opinion and idea about the project. We will use slack or phones to communicate when we are off campus, and we will have frequent check ups on each other's progress when we are here at code fellows.

* Conflict Plan:

  When conflict arises, first we will be patient and understanding of each other, in that building a project in a short amount of time might be stressful. Next the person that is not involved with the conflict should act as a team manager and intervene. We should also have a talk to clear out any miscommunication or misunderstanding.
  We also have the option to include our TAs our instructor in case of a bigger conflict.

* Work Plan:

  First we will start with the HTML and javascript part, and we won't be doing any CSS until we are done with the functionality of the website.
  Also we will create our project in Github and have a to-do, in-progress and done columns where each member will grab an issue, move to in progress column and work on it, then move it to done when his/her work is over.
  We will also have each day of the week an assigned team manager with the responsibility of organizing two stand ups, one in the morning and one in the afternoon, doing check ins with the team member to check on the work progress and also doing the pull requests merges, unless it is his/her own, then he/she will assign that task to another team member.
  For the code that is comment worthy, we will add the names of all contributors.

* Git Process:

  Each member will create a new branch everyday with his/her name and the name of the task he/she is working on.
  Pull requests will be merged by the team manager for the day, unless it is his/her own, then he/she will assign that task to another team member.
  Also pull requests will be reviewed by 2 team members to check if the code is ready to merge.
