### Project Topic: Quiz based on differently themed images

### Project Pitch:
#### * Problem: A large amount of information out there

#### * Solution is to create a game where a series of images are displayed, and based on the image the user chooses there is a quiz that populates the bottom of the page. They take the quiz to test their knowledge, then are directed to another page with the correct answers and information supporting why it's correct or just about the topic in general.

#### * Benefits: teach people something they didn't know or sharpen their knowledge of it
