### Project Topic: Quiz based on differently themed images

### Project Pitch:
#### * Problem: A large amount of information out there

#### * Solution is to create a game where a series of images are displayed, and based on the image the user chooses there is a quiz that populates the bottom of the page. They take the quiz to test their knowledge, then are directed to another page with the correct answers and information supporting why it's correct or just about the topic in general.

#### * Benefits: teach people something they didn't know or sharpen their knowledge of it

### Details about this game:
It is a quiz that starts with 3 images. Each image has a category, pop culture, sports, and travel/geography, that corresponds to a quiz. Each quiz has 5 questions with some answer choices. The submit button, once clicked, tallies up the score and puts it on the chalkboard image on the score page. There is also an about us page that includes all the creators' pictures and a little bit about us.
